# SpellChecker-draft
I was given this project as part of an interview. They set up the overall frame and gave detailed project requirements, and I completed the meat of the project. Please use NUnite3TestAdapter if you'd like to run the unit tests I created. I plan on going through and learning what else I can do with the LINQ library to optimize it/show off something other than the simple arrays I've already used. I could not figure out how to read the dictionary.com page in the time given, but I didn't actually have to be able to read it in order to show that the word was spelled correctly. If the word entered existed on dictionary.com, the code I've written would return true as it'd follow the URL format ( https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ + USER-ENTERED-WORD ). If the URL did not stick to that format, it meant the word did not exist, and is therefore spelled incorrectly. ----Here is a link to the test adapter: https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit3TestAdapter/3.13.0
