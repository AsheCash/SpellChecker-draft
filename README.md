# SpellChecker-draft
I was given this project as part of an interview. Please use NUnite3TestAdapter if you'd like to run the unit tests I created. I plan on going through and learning what else I can do with the LINQ library to optimize it/show off something other than the simple arrays I've already used. https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit3TestAdapter/3.13.0
